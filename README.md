# js_password_generator03

This is a password generator given to me in Module 3 of our bootcamp. The CSS and HTML code was given to us but we were responsible for creating the javascript for this project. I systematically created the code in order to alert and show prompts and allow the user to input their desired data in order to be given a random password containing their selected choices.

# Description

The task at hand for this assignment was to build working code in order to give functionality to this password generator webpage. When the user clicks the "generate" button they are supposed to input information and answer a series of questions. After that info is verified the user is given a random password they can use.

# Installation

Code for this program can be downloaded from: https://github.com/gardnerd06/js_password_generator03
